What Is Wordle and How to Play? 

“Wordle” is a game where the player tries to guess a dictionary word based on the hints that will be provided to the player in Wordle.

Once the player start guessing the word, the input letters will be reflected as yellow,gray or green tiles after user click submit. For example, a green tile means that the player predicted the correct placement of a letter in the correct word. A yellow tile means that the letter is present in the correct word, but the letter is in the wrong position. The gray tile means a letter does not exist in the correct word. 
We have also added a function for user to play this game for multiple times till he logs out.
